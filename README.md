abstract = {Thermoelectric materials represent an innovative energy solution, capable of converting waste heat into usable electrical power. Recent advances have leveraged machine learning to identify new thermoelectric materials, yet challenges remain in balancing applicability, feature complexity, and interpretability. In this study, we introduce an interpretable framework based on ensemble learning and Magpie chemical element features to predict the power factor (PF) of various materials. Our approach yields approximate analytical expressions for PF using simple elemental features, providing both accuracy and transparency. We validate our predictions with density functional theory, successfully identifying two high-PF selenides as promising candidates for thermoelectric applications.}
